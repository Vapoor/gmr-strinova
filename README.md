# Guess My Rank (gmr) - Strinova Edition
A discord bot allowing to create from zero a sort of guess-my-rank game on discord channels.

## How to setup
- I would recommand running a Virtual Environment for the Setup, but it's up to you.
```setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate // (Linux)
venv\Scripts\Activate // (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- ## NO TOKEN = NO BOT :)

## What does he do ?
- Receiving a clip from the game Strinova, and **auto** compressing / blurring killfeed, then send it to a channel for human verification.
- You can change these channels with the command **/setup**
- A command **/results** allows to check for the last 25 clips the results with a graph of the currents guesses
